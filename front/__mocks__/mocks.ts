Garth, <a href=\"../../light-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ayla</a>, and their older brother <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekt</a> were joy riding when their ship lost power and came down on the world of <a href=\"/korbal/4020-56256/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56256\">Korbal</a>. They devised a scheme to recharge their ship's energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal's lightning beasts. They underestimated the beasts' power and were all bathed in bio-electric energy. After their return with new found powers, Mekt disappeared. Garth left home to look for his brother.

When his sister arrived to join the Legion as Winath's official representative, Garth quit in shame. He went on to work for the industrialist <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/4005-12846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12846\">Leland McCauley</a> on his <a href=\"/workforce/4060-47189/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce</a> team. Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/4005-21136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21136\">President Chu</a>. She was impeached, and Brande was made president in her place.

They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion's image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4466257668712\" data-width=\"815\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 815px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\"><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Lad (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later.

Garth assisted Legionnaires past and present in hunting down <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> to save Cosmic Boy. <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> then happened and Garth and the other Legionnaires sacrificed themselves to save the timestream and create a new reality.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>The Death of Garth</h4><p>When half the Legion was stuck in the 20th century, Brande personally asked Garth to become Legion leader. Live Wire wasn't comfortable with the idea and shortly thereafter hosted a leadership election for a replacement. Once the team was reunited, he began a relationship with Saturn Girl and ultimately proposed. Garth and Imra were one of several Legionnaires lost in a spatial rift. Saturn Girl's manipulation of the team put a strain on their relationship. Live Wire sacrificed himself fighting their former teammate, <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>, who had spent billions of years becoming a mad god.</p><h4>Garth's Body Restored</h4><p>Garth's spirit, however, was stored in the living crystals of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>'s corpse, and he was able to return to the Legion - but in Element Lad's body. This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth's original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal. He then rejoined his team as they pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Electricity Control</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3312693498452\" data-width=\"646\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 646px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\"><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Powers</figcaption></figure><p>Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity and direct bolts of electricity accurately. Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Silver Age: Lightning Man</h3><p>In the original debut of the Legion of Supervillians, this team came from a time when the Legion of Superheroes had reach adulthood.

He had an origin similar to the comic books, though this time his sister Ayla didn't survive the attack by the lightning beasts as children. This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him. In season two, Garth lost his arm to his brother and <a href=\"/imperiex/4005-10006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10006\">Imperiex</a> and was given a cybernetic one.

Naltor's native denizens are genetically inclined to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age, Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future while awake, than any other. Nura's exceptional beauty often hid the fact that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy's intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> on a mission in space. Determined to prevent their deaths, she introduced herself to the Legion using the code name of Dream Girl.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dream Girl was created in 1964 by writer <a href=\"/edmond-hamilton/4040-42401/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42401\">Edmond Hamilton</a> and artist <a href=\"/john-forte/4040-7532/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7532\">John Forte</a>, first appearing in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/4050-3105/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3105\">Adventure Comics</a> #310. She became the sixth female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall. As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"../../marilyn-monroe/29-16582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe</a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on her right cheek. Despite her looks, Dream Girl was also conceived to be one of the Legion's most intelligent and capable members.</p><p> </p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1644352\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 516px\" data-ratio=\"1.4321705426357\" data-width=\"516\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1644352\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (classic 70's costume)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg 516w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1644352-dreamgirl_lightle.jpg 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (classic 70's costume)</figcaption></figure><p>Nura knew from her vision that several of the Legionnaires would face death in an explosion in space if they remained members of the team. At one of the Legion's open try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"/starman/4005-1260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\">Star Boy</a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"/lightning-lass/4005-30997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Lightning Lass</a>, who had her electrical powers seemingly removed by Nura's Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning Lass' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of gravity.</p><p>Once the truth of Dream Girl's scheme came out, the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/4060-47111/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> so she would have time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance. Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> and <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy</a> were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team.</p><p>With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion's sexy-costume era of the 70's), and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team, and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her natural charm and charisma.</p><p> </p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 328px\" data-ratio=\"2.6036585365854\" data-width=\"328\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:260.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-247)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" data-width=\"245\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 328w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 245w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-247)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 328w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" data-width=\"245\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-247)</figcaption></figure><p>Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour</i> Legion stories. For most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still Star Boy's girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy, falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of <a href=\"/black-witch/4005-30998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30998\">Mysa</a>, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained Legion membership under the codename Dreamer. Unlike other continuities her Legion costume featured a cape, as well as a diamond-shaped \"cleavage window\" in the front.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 324px\" data-ratio=\"2.141975308642\" data-width=\"324\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:214.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 324w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 298w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 324w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p>Dream Girl had a more disconnected and \"spaced out\" personality in this continuity, since her precognition often interfered with her perception of current reality and she had trouble differentiating between the two. She wore a midriff-baring costume with a silver top and black leggings. In her first action as a Legionnaire she stopped an assassination attempt on the United Planets delegates by a spy. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> had compiled data for three days and sent Dream Girl, <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid</a>, and <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a> to stop the assassin. The Legionnaires looked like they were beaten, until Karate Kid woke Dream Girl from a daydream and she took down the assassin down with ease, saying that she thought they had already defeated him. Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl's precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later, Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"../../shadow-lass/29-1261/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Lass</a> and Brainiac 5 were all sent to Dream Girl's home planet of Naltor to investigate why no one under the age of 18 was able to sleep.</p><p>Brainiac 5 eventually realized that he was in love with her, right before she was killed in the battle that destroyed most of the Legion Headquarters. He stopped her soul from escaping, and she went to live only in Brainiac's mind while he tried to figure out a way to restore her body.</p><p> </p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2120994\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2120994-dg11.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 278px\" data-ratio=\"1.1294964028777\" data-width=\"278\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2120994-dg11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2120994\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (current continuity)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-width=\"278\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2120994-dg11.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2120994-dg11.jpg 278w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (current continuity)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2120994-dg11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/92932/2120994-dg11.jpg 278w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-width=\"278\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (current continuity)</figcaption></figure><p>With the \"retroboot,\" Dream Girl and the Legion returned to being very much like the original team prior to the Five Year Gap, with a few differences. At the beginning of the story arc several members of the Legion (including the original Dream Girl in her classic silver costume) mysteriously appeared in the 21st century. Other Legionnaires were scattered and trapped in different places throughout the universe. Dream Girl was captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain <a href=\"../../doctor-destiny/29-10453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny</a> in <a href=\"../../arkham-asylum/34-31682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum</a>, where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions. She was rescued by the <a href=\"../../justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society</a> and <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League</a>, and was reunited with her longtime love Thom Kallor (formerly Star Boy), who had been flung back in time to become the new <a href=\"../../starman/29-7646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman</a>. In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic, since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time unprepared. She felt terribly for him and believed that the 21st-century methods of treating his mental illness were barbaric. Dream Girl has since established a connection to the realm of '<a href=\"/the-dreaming/4020-55857/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55857\">The Dreaming</a>,' further enhancing her precognitive powers. She also correctly predicted the threat of <a href=\"../../superman-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> in <a href=\"../../final-crisis/39-51642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Crisis</a>: <a href=\"../../final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/49-22674/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Three Worlds</a>, the recent storyline which united all three versions of the Legion together. After the <a href=\"/last-stand-of-new-krypton/4045-56041/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56041\">war</a> with <a href=\"/new-krypton/4020-56084/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56084\">New Krypton</a> in the 21st century, Dream Girl was able to bring Star Boy back home to the 31st century to get him the medical treatment he needed.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>Romance with Star Boy</h4><p>Though Nura continued to receive constant attention from the unattached male Legionnaires (and even some of the attached ones), <a href=\"../../star-boy/29-1260/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star Boy</a> (Thom Kallor) was the one who eventually managed to capture her heart. Nura became very close to him and she was romantically involved with Star Boy for many years. Dream Girl spent several years as someone who needed to be rescued, partly due to her effective but non-combative power. Not wanting to be a liability she trained intensively in hand-to-hand combat in order to better serve the team on the field. She was a quick study and became a highly skilled martial artist, second on the team in unarmed combat to only <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid.</a> Her precognitive power to foresee an opponent's moves before they even made them further enhanced her effectiveness as a fighter.</p><p> </p><h4>Leaving The Legion</h4><p>At one point Nura took a temporary leave from the team, since she believed she had initially joined under false pretenses. She had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires while dreaming and proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion in order to save their lives. During this time she joined the <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> until she reunited with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for accidentally killing Nura's former lover, a Naltorian named Kenz Nahor, in self-defense after Nahor attempted to kill Star Boy out of jealousy.</p><p> </p><h4>Leader of the Legion</h4><p>Dream Girl soon rejoined the Legion and continued serving as a highly valued member. After <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad</a>'s term as Legion leader went horribly awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially scoffed at the idea of the Legion's glamor girl winning the job, until they realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>).</p><p>Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"../../great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga</a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a> attempted to conquer the whole of the United Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl's able leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle. During this time Nura's sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling herself the <a href=\"../../white-witch/29-30998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Witch</a>.</p><p>Though Dream Girl again ran for leader the following term, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship had suffered. After Star Boy left the team to become planetary champion of his home planet, <a href=\"/xanthu/4020-56504/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56504\">Xanthu</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>The Universo Project</h4><p>Dream Girl became one of the first Legion members to demonstrate sufficient willpower to utilize her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving her the ability of telekinesis. She later was one of four Legionnaires singled out by <a href=\"/universo/4005-22717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22717\">Universo</a> as the most dangerous obstacles in his attempt to take over the Earth (along with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four were captured and held prisoner with their memories suppressed. Saturn Girl eventually regained her memory and helped her teammates engineer an escape, after which they turned the tables on Universo. It was assumed that they were isolated as the most dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have been that those four had the most resistance to Universo's mind control -- even more than the Legion's (then current) telepath, <a href=\"/tellus/4005-30996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30996\">Tellus</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Mind-controlled by Atmos</h4><p>When the ruler of Xanthu (Star Boy's home planet) asked Thom to be their resident hero since their champion <a href=\"/atmos/4005-28222/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28222\">Atmos</a> had gone missing, Star Boy reluctantly had to take his leave from the Legion and Nura. While Star Boy was away, Atmos turned up during a Legion mission and Nura inexplicably found herself intensely attracted to him. To the surprise of her teammates, she broke up her long-distance relationship with Star Boy and jumped into a romance with Atmos. The truth later became apparent to her that Atmos was somehow using his mental powers to take over her emotions and sap her will. Furious at being so manipulated, she used her own formidable willpower to slowly build up a tolerance to Atmos' mind-sapping powers. She kept this a secret from her erstwhile lover until one night when Atmos had fallen asleep. She regained enough control over herself to activate her Legion flight ring alarm and knocked Atmos out cold with one punch the moment he woke up. Free of Atmos' influence, Nura immediately went back to her true love Thom.</p><p> </p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 103px\" data-ratio=\"2.3495145631068\" data-width=\"103\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\"><img alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" data-width=\"103\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg 103w\"><noscript><img alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" data-width=\"103\"></noscript></a><figcaption>High Seer (Five Years Later)</figcaption></figure><p>After the devastation of the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/4045-56080/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars</a>, Legion continuity was re-started after the period known as the Five Year Gap. The galactic economy had collapsed and Earth's government became very hostile towards the Legion. Nura left the team and made her return to Naltor to become its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through the troubled times, and under her leadership her world became one of the most stable economies in the United Planets. But Nura felt alone and missed Star Boy terribly, so she went through a series of relationships with several men during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate some sort of time flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and just before the destruction of the time line, she shared a kiss with her old flame Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> event.</p><p> </p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>Guiding the Legion</h4><p>On Naltor, the Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction, her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army. When she woke up she said one word... 'Brainy'. Dream Girl lead the team to the public service broadcaster where they found Brainy \"attacking the problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security and comfort. She chose the former.</p><p> </p><h4>Relationship with Brainiac 5</h4><p>When the team returned to Legion headquarters, Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were married.</p><p> </p><h4>Foreseeing Her Own Death</h4><p>After this the Legion's true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a href=\"../../terra-firma/65-47457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma</a>, lead by the super-powered <a href=\"../../elysion/29-1274/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion</a> and <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a>. Terra Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem. Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos, the answer to Dream Girl's problem was answered... she could not see past her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.</p><h4>Return to Life</h4><p>After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed Dream Girl's body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful: Nura's consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to get married.</p><p> </p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>The New 52</h4><p>The efforts of DC to revitalize its titles led to the New 52 reboot of the universe, in which all DC titles were relaunched simultaneously. The Legion of Super Heroes reverted to a close analogue of their original continuity prior to any of reboots, but it remains to be seen the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and Star Boy are once again an official couple, though she also appears to have a strong relationship with <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Precognition</h3><p>Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions. This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, but Nura's ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see a few seconds into the future at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Unarmed Combat</strong></p><p>Because of her passive power, Dream Girl's early portrayal was a damsel-in-distress who could be easily defeated and captured by enemies, obliging her teammates to rescue her. She resolved to change this and spent long hours with the Legion's ultimate martial arts master, Karate Kid, who gave her extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. She quickly became one of his most gifted students, to the point where she is now the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows her to predict her opponent's moves even before they make them and map out a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician, and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than her, such as the <a href=\"/\">Persuader</a>.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few Legionnaires to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual prowess. Because of her great intellect she was chosen for capture by the villain Universo, since he regarded her as one of the Legion's four biggest threats to his domination of Earth (the others being <a href=\"/saturn-girl/4005-1273/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\">Saturn Girl</a>, <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy</a>, and Brainiac 5).</p><p> </p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. Dream Girl has also employed the ring in various ways unknown to other Legionnaires. Using her great willpower, Nura has used the flight ring to levitate and move other nearby objects as though she has telekinesis.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 528px\" data-ratio=\"1.7405303030303\" data-width=\"528\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" data-width=\"367\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 528w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 367w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 528w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" data-width=\"367\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Batch SW6)</figcaption></figure><p>The devastation of the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/4045-56080/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars</a> caused original Legion continuity to jump ahead five years in what is now known as the Five Year Gap.
